# Testing

This repository holds two deliverables with separate suites:

| Suite | Where | Run it |
|---|---|---|
| **Android app (Kotlin)** | this document | `./gradlew test` |
| **Web platform (browser)** | [`WEB_TESTING.md`](WEB_TESTING.md) | `npm test` · `npm run verify` |

This document describes how AdShield Pro is built and how its automated tests are run.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version used by the project |
| --- | --- |
| JDK | 17 or newer (build tested with JDK 21 toolchain config) |
| Android SDK Platform | 37 (`compileSdk = 37`, `targetSdk = 36`) |
| Android build-tools | installed automatically by AGP 9.4.1 |
| Gradle | 9.7.1 via the committed wrapper (`./gradlew`) |
| Android Gradle plugin | 9.4.1 (built-in Kotlin, no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| Kotlin / KSP | 2.4.21 / 2.3.13 |

Set `ANDROID_HOME` (or add an `sdk.dir` line to `local.properties`) before building.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug          # installable debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease        # signed release APK (needs the keystore env vars below)
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease          # Play Store AAB
```

Release signing is configured through environment variables or Gradle properties
(see `docs/BUILD_AND_SIGNING_GUIDE.md`):

```bash
export ADSHIELD_KEYSTORE_PATH=/path/to/release.jks
export ADSHIELD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=…
export ADSHIELD_KEY_ALIAS=…
export ADSHIELD_KEY_PASSWORD=…
```

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/android-build.yml` runs on every push to `main` / agent branches and on pull
requests. It installs JDK 21 + Android SDK Platform 37.x and runs, in order:

1. Capability matrix freshness check (`tools/generate_capability_matrix.py --check`)
2. UI performance gates (`tools/check_ui_performance.py`)
3. `:app:compileDebugKotlin` — fails fast on toolchain problems
4. `:app:assembleDebug` — APK packaging
5. `:app:assembleRelease` — R8 minification + resource shrinking (throwaway CI keystore), then the
   universal ABI gate (`tools/check_universal_release.py`)
6. `:app:testDebugUnitTest` — then discovers every `@Test` case in `app/src/test` and asserts the
   JUnit XML reports the same number, with zero failures/errors/skips
7. `:app:lintDebug` — hard gate, the build fails on any lint error

The debug APK is uploaded as the `adshield-pro-<version>-debug-apk` artifact.

## Unit tests

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest          # runs app/src/test/**
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests 'com.adshield.pro.AdShieldEngineTestSuite'
```

HTML report: `app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest/index.html`.

`AdShieldEngineTestSuite` is a pure JVM (Robolectric-free) suite. It exercises the
device-independent engine code directly, which is where all DNS, filtering and scoring
logic lives. `AetherCoreTest`, `BatteryIntelligenceTestSuite`, `DashboardPresentationTest`,
`SecurityCenterTestSuite` and `CapabilityRegistryTest` cover the decision core, battery/thermal
rules, dashboard honesty/motion rules, security scoring and capability-report constraints:

| Area | Covered behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `DnsPacketCodec` | RFC 1035 parsing of A/AAAA questions, compression pointers, malformed/cyclic packets, NXDOMAIN and `0.0.0.0`/`::` sinkhole synthesis, SERVFAIL synthesis, transaction-ID rewriting, TTL extraction |
| UDP delivery limits | `fitResponseToUdpLimit` preserves ID/RCODE/question and sets TC=1 when an upstream answer cannot fit a single tunnel datagram; `udpPayloadCapacity` per IP version |
| `IpPacketFraming` | IPv4/IPv6 UDP and TCP parsing, IPv4 header options, TCP options, fragmentation rejection, RFC 1071 / RFC 8200 checksums (verified to recompute to zero), and segmentation of large TCP DNS answers so no packet exceeds the tunnel MTU |
| `UpstreamDnsResolver` | Upstream answers are only accepted when they are responses carrying the query's transaction ID; only NOERROR/NXDOMAIN answers are cacheable; cache keys are scoped to the active resolver endpoint; IPv6 fallback server list |
| `FilterRuleEngine` | Protection-mode category gating, custom allow/block precedence, wildcards, hosts/Adblock list parsing, duplicate counting, HTML/binary rejection, conflict analysis, snapshot rollback, concurrent evaluation |
| `BrowserContentBlocker` | Tracking-parameter stripping, request blocking, site allowlists, cosmetic script generation, DNS-label-boundary third-party detection |
| `RuleBasedOptimizationPredictor` | Healthy vs. stressed device scoring, bottleneck severities, `formatBytes` formatting |
| `DashboardPresentation` | Counter scope selection and clamping, event titles/severity, motion gating, nav scroll targeting, stable live-event ids |
| `PrivateSearch` | Provider fallback for corrupt prefs, HTTPS-only search endpoints, percent-encoding (UTF-8, reserved chars), query-injection resistance, address-vs-search resolution |
| `ScanJournal` | Strictly increasing scan ids, bounded retention, persistence round-trip incl. legacy records, honest empty report, quarantine path-traversal safety, progress clamping |
| `IntelligenceMapTestSuite` | Event sanitizer (evidence required, size bounds, secret/PII redaction, severity escalation), factory routing (DNS/scan/battery/VPN/automation), aggregator state derivation from real inputs only, dedupe policy, repository round-trip/prune/corrupt rows, hit-testing, pinch focal stability, tap-vs-drag, camera lerp/clamping, recommendations, aggregation performance budget |

Instrumentation (`androidTest`) and manual on-device checks are still required for anything
that touches Android framework services — `VpnService` tunnel establishment, the WebView
browser, notifications, WorkManager scheduling and Room migrations on a real upgrade path.
Those cannot be exercised by JVM unit tests.

## Manual smoke test (device / emulator, API 29+)

1. Install the debug APK, open the app, tap the shield and accept the VPN consent dialog.
2. Open a browser and load a page; verify `Blocked` counters increase on the Home screen.
3. Open **Statistics** and confirm queries appear in real time (requires detailed logging).
4. Add a custom block rule (`||example.com^`) in **Ad Blocker → Rules** and confirm the domain
   is blocked immediately without restarting protection.
5. Switch protection modes and confirm blocking changes take effect without a tunnel restart.
6. Reboot the device with protection enabled to verify the boot receiver restores the tunnel.
7. If the release build is used, confirm R8 did not strip Room/serialization metadata by
   opening **Statistics** and **Optimizer** (both read from Room/DataStore).
8. Run a file scan, quarantine the file, verify it, restore it to a new location and confirm the
   SHA-256 matches; then delete the quarantined copy. Try "Quarantine & delete original" on a file
   this app does not own and confirm the app reports that Android refused the deletion.
9. Enable scheduled scanning, force the job (or wait for the period) and confirm a record appears
   in Security → History with source "Scheduled".
10. Switch the private search provider in Ad Blocker → Browser → shield controls, search from the
    address bar, and confirm the chosen provider is used after an app restart.
11. Open **Intel**. Drag the map, pinch-zoom, double-tap, tap each of the seven nodes and the core,
    long-press a node, reset the camera and centre on a module. Confirm a pan never opens a panel
    and that rotating the device re-fits the map without losing selection.
12. Tap **Pause** on the map: the header must show the frozen aggregate and a count of events
    arriving while paused; DNS counters on Home must keep increasing. Resume and confirm the map
    catches up.
13. Trigger a real malware DNS block (threat feed test domain) or run a scan that produces a
    finding; confirm a new event appears in the timeline, the matching node raises its state and a
    pulse travels to the core.
14. Use the timeline filters (module, severity, 15 min, search) and confirm both the list and the
    map markers change accordingly; clear history and confirm the confirmation dialog and the
    explicit empty state afterwards.
15. In layout-edit mode drag a node, leave the screen, return and confirm the position persisted.
    Then use **Reset camera** and confirm the layout is unchanged.
16. Upgrade-install over the previous version and confirm existing DNS stats, custom rules,
    filter sources, scan history and settings are intact (additive schema v4 migration).
17. Scroll Home and Live quickly with detailed logging enabled; confirm the feed stays smooth,
   the scroll-to-top button appears after scrolling, and the shield stops animating when the
   tunnel is paused or traffic is idle. Enable reduced motion / remove animations in developer
   options and confirm the shield renders statically.
18. Open **Intel → Feeds & connectors**, pick a module and confirm the header counts match the
    registry (176 listed / 157 implemented at the time of writing). Open a feed, press **SYNC NOW**
    and confirm the status, HTTP code, latency and indicator count are populated from the real
    response — a connector that has never succeeded must not read CONNECTED.
19. Put the device in airplane mode (or block the host) and sync again: the connector must show
    OFFLINE/ERROR with a readable reason and a retry delay, and the rest of the app must keep
    working from cache. Reconnect and confirm the next sync recovers.
20. Run a native probe (e.g. installed-app inventory, connectivity, battery, sensor privacy) and
    confirm every value is a real reading; deny a permission (usage access, location) and confirm
    the connector reports a restriction instead of inventing data.
21. Use **Check against cached intelligence** with a domain from a synced feed, then a random
    domain: the verdict, score and reasons must differ, and the disclaimer ("a match does not
    prove compromise") must be visible.
22. Set `connector-sync` to run sooner (or change the device clock), wait for a background cycle
    and confirm freshness updates in the registry and the Automation node records the job result.
    Then force-stop the app and confirm the stored state — including failures — survives restart.
23. Upgrade-install over the previous version and confirm DNS stats, rules, scan history and the
    intelligence event log survive the additive schema v5 migration (connector_state and
    threat_indicators are new tables).

## World Monitor v2 Android acceptance

The new `WorldMonitorTestSuite` checks native message origin, URL/export bounds, response shapes,
provider allowlist, APK asset wiring, scheduling constraints and country-coverage disclosures. Shared
runtime behaviour is covered by the web suite, including booting `world/embed.html` in a DOM.

On a physical device, additionally verify:

- The **World** tab loads its packaged UI in airplane mode, with no invented current events.
- Refresh has independent provider error states, respects TLS and never disrupts the DNS VPN.
- Export each MIME type through the Storage Access Framework; cancellation and provider write
  failures must show feedback. Import a JSON watchlist from a user-selected document provider.
- Country list, touch pan/pinch, selected markers, dialogs, screen reader and light/dark contrast.
- Enable daily refresh, background/reboot the phone, and inspect the actual job outcome/snapshot;
  disabled schedule cancels work. Force-stop/doze may delay jobs, which must not produce fake data.
- Updating from 2.10.2 to 5.1.0 (code 50100) retains native settings, VPN rules, Room databases and
  signing continuity. The World Monitor workspace is additive; no existing Room migration is needed.

Daily scheduling and SAF interactions are device acceptance items, not claimed to be emulated by
JVM or DOM tests.
